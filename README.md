# AFLP_finder
fast identify Animal FAS Like PKS (AFLP)s. 
It utilizes the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique for dimensionality reduction, which is based on the alignment scores to a series of ketosynthase related Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HDBSCAN clustering method is then employed to identify the possible AFLP clusters for each protein sequence input.

## Requirements
* Bash
* R >= 3.2
* R packages: ggplot2, Rtsne, getopt, dbscan
*To install R packages just run R environment and execute command:
*install.packages(c("ggplot2","Rtsne","getopt","dbscan"))*

* HMMER 3.3.2

*prodigal   (if input is DNA file)

AFLP_finder was tested on MacOs 11, Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.

## How to use
At first, add the folder with executables to your PATH variable.
export PATH="/path_to_AFLP_FInder/":$PATH

then run "run_AFLP_finder.sh <KS-protein.fa> <output_path>"
## input:
ideal inputs will be protein sequences of KS domain of iterative PKSs, they can be generated by antiSMASH, interpro..., keeping the input sequence number <100 will give better resolution in output ploting figure.
## results:
this plot shows the INPUT_KSs (purple) are adjacent to AFLPs (light blue),  so the INPUT_KSs are identified as AFLPs.

output table example: it tells that INPUT_KS1 is clustered in cluster 4, cluster 4 contains 100% of the training AFLPs
