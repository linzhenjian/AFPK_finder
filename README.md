# AFPK_finder
fast identify Animal FAS Like PKS (AFPK)s. 
It utilizes the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique for dimensionality reduction, which is based on the alignment scores to a series of ketosynthase related Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HDBSCAN clustering method is then employed to identify the possible AFPK clusters for each protein sequence input.

## Requirements
* Bash
* R >= 3.2
* R packages: ggplot2, Rtsne, getopt, dbscan
* To install R packages just run R environment and execute command:
install.packages(c("ggplot2","Rtsne","getopt","dbscan"))
* HMMER 3.3.2
* prodigal   (if input is DNA file)




AFPK_finder was tested on MacOs 11, Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.

## How to use
At first, add the folder with executables to your PATH variable.

git clone https://github.com/linzhenjian/AFPK_finder.git

cd AFPK_finder

chmod 771 *

export PATH="/path_to_AFPK_FInder/":$PATH

then run "run_AFPK_finder.sh -p testing_data/ar-clade1.fa -o output -t 16 "  or "run_AFPK_finder.sh -d DNA_KS.fa -o output -t 16 "
running time for a input with 100 seqence is about 5 min in a normal desktop computer
## input:
ideal inputs will be intact protein sequences of KS domain of iterative PKSs, they can be generated by antiSMASH, interpro..., keeping the input sequence number <100 will give better resolution in output ploting figure. we did find that truncated KS sequence input will cause misidentificaton.
## results:
this plot shows the INPUT_KSs (purple) are adjacent to AFPKs (light blue),  so the INPUT_KSs are identified as AFPKs.

output table example: it tells that INPUT_KS1 is clustered in cluster 4, cluster 4 contains 100% of the training AFPKs
